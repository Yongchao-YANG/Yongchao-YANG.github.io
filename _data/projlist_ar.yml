  description: Currently visual inspection is the predominant technique used to inspect infrastructure such as bridges. The general rule is that bridges on public roads should be inspected every 2 years. Structural members that are underwater are to be subject to a visual inspection by a diver. Visual inspection is also a common technique for building inspections and used in applications such as aircraft inspection, baggage inspection, and inspection of high-value manufactured components.  More than 80% of inspections on large, transport aircraft occur using visual inspection techniques, and the percentage is higher for small aircraft. In recent years, visual inspection of aircraft has expanded to make use of drones to aid the visual inspector’s ability to see all parts of an aircraft without having to use ladders and stairs. Despite the widespread use of visual inspections, they do have their downsides. Inaccuracies during structural visual inspections have been found to be the result of variations in training and experience, a lack of understanding of inspection requirements and procedures, interpretation of inspection practices, and attitude and work ethic. Lack of policy can also affect consistency between classifications resulting from visual inspection of infrastructure. Our research explore the merging augmented reality tools that feature a variety of sensors, computation, and communication resources to enable relevant structural inspection data to be collected at very high resolution in an relatively unambiguous manner.
