  description: The resolution of sensing systems is fundamentally governed by the diffraction limit, which indicates that the minimum resolvable feature size is in the order of the wavelength of a propagating wave. To image smaller features (e.g., hidden material defects), short wavelengths (or high frequencies) need to be employed. However, when the frequency is increased to employ a shorter wavelength, the propagating wave suffers higher attenuation that limits the imaging range that can be covered. Implementing high-power equipment that increases the excitation energy and thus imaging range is costly and sometimes risky. Moreover, as the excitation frequency increases, the coherent noise due to material backscattering and the emergence of multiple scattering limits the upper bound of frequency.  We study computational super-resolution sensing, aiming to computationally recover the sub-wavelength object features (e.g., material defects) from measurements taken with insufficient wavelength; however, it is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. Our research explores and leverages the power of deep learning to investigate the feasibility of enabling super-resolution ultrasonic beamforming that computationally exceeds the diffraction limit and visualizes sub-wavelength material defects of metallic structures.
