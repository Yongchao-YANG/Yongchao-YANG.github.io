  description: The resolution of sensing systems is fundamentally governed by the diffraction limit, which indicates that the minimum resolvable feature size is in the order of the wavelength of a propagating wave. To image smaller features (e.g., hidden material defects), short wavelengths (or high frequencies) need to be employed. However, when the frequency is increased to employ a shorter wavelength, the propagating wave suffers higher attenuation that limits the imaging range that can be covered. Implementing high-power equipment that increases the excitation energy and thus imaging range is costly and sometimes risky. Moreover, as the excitation frequency increases, the coherent noise due to material backscattering and the emergence of multiple scattering limits the upper bound of frequency.  We study computational super-resolution sensing, aiming to computationally recover the sub-wavelength object features (e.g., material defects) from measurements taken with insufficient wavelength; however, it is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. Our research explores and leverages the power of deep learning to investigate the feasibility of enabling super-resolution ultrasonic beamforming that computationally exceeds the diffraction limit and visualizes sub-wavelength material defects of metallic structures.

- title: "Full-field, high-resolution optical imaging and analysis of structural dynamics"
  image: resViDeoMAgic.jpeg
  description: Engineering structures are typically large-scale and exhibit complex behaviors under dynamic loads from operational environment (e.g., wind and traffic) as well as natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes and hurricanes) and man-made extreme events (e.g., impact and blast). High spatial and temporal resolution structural response (vibration) measurements and modeling are thus required for high-fidelity characterization, analysis, and prediction of the structure’s response. However, it is a significant challenge to obtain high-resolution structural vibration measurements using traditional techniques. For example, the widely-used accelerometers and strain-gauge sensors can only be placed at a limited number of places on the structure, providing low spatial resolution measurements. Laser vibrometers offer high-resolution measurements, but are expensive and make sequential measurements that are time-consuming. On the other hand, photogrammetry using digital video cameras is relatively low-cost, agile, and provide remote, high spatial resolution, simultaneous, measurements where every pixel effectively becomes a measurement point on the structure. We develop a new full-field imaging method to enable the blind extraction and realistic visualization of the full-field, high-resolution, dynamics response of an operating structure from only its digital video measurements under natural white light illuminations using video motion manipulation and unsupervised machine learning techniques. We investigate the feasibility of applying this method to detect minute, non-visible structural damage at a pixel resolution with laboratory experiments and real-world case studies of various engineering structures. We also extend it to 3-dimensional full-field imaging of structural dynamics.
