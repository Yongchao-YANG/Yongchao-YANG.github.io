  description: Nonlinear systems typically exhibit complex dynamical behaviors, characterizing which has remained a long-standing challenge across science and engineering fields. While normal modal transformation exactly characterizes any linear systems, there exists no such a general mathematical framework for nonlinear dynamical systems. Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are natural generalization of the normal modal transformation for nonlinear systems; however, existing research for identifying NNMs has relied on theoretical derivation or numerical computation from the closed-form equation of the system, which is usually unknown. Our research aims to develop physics-integrated deep learning methodology for data-driven identification of characteristics of nonlinear normal modes and generalizing the modal superposition to nonlinear dynamics.

  description: Dynamical systems in the real world generally exhibit complex nonlinear phenomena such as frequency-energy dependence and modal interaction. Their accurate modeling and representation typically require high-dimensional models, resulting in great difficulties in analysis and computations. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) aims to alleviate such modeling and computation challenges by identifying reduced-order models (ROMs) that accurately capture the nonlinear dynamics embedded in the original high-dimensional space. Establishing a ROM generally involves two steps - (i) seeking a lower-dimensional subspace spanned by a reduced set of bases for the dynamical system; (ii) formulating the ROM by projecting the full-order model (FOM) onto the subspace. Fundamental challenges in ROM - (c.1) the selected bases are required to result in an optimal lowest-dimensional ROM with high-fidelity reconstruction; (c.2) the determination of the reduced set of bases is required to be efficient; and (c.3) the bases are required to retain the underlying nonlinear dynamics with clear physical interpretations. Our research aims to address these challenges and develop optimally lowest-dimensional ROM for efficient and effective representation of nonlinear dynamical systems.
